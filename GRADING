Javascript (including creating your own objects with inheritance)
  Clearly achieved this, inheritance is only used in the elements (there is a base element, which mostly handles moving and resizing the element). See the declaration of Elem, as well as Rectangle, Text, and Img.

Canvas (somehow this must be included meaningfully)
  The tutorial is done using a canvas. Self-explanatory.

HTML (including a reasonably wide range of techniques, such as tables, forms with form validation, etc)
  A table is used to display the generated code in Show Source.

CSS (including a reasonably range of techniques, such as reset, pseudo-selectors, fixed and fluid layout, transitions and animations, etc)
  So much css...

DOM manipulation
  All the manipulation! Everything needs to be manipulated!

AJAX and/or JSON-P client
  Well we export and import JSON, hopefully that counts. We also use an external API (filepicker.io) to load images.

jQuery
  Everywhere. Literally.
